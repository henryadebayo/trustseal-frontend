# ðŸš€ Quick Manual Redeploy to Vercel

Since your initial deployment worked with manual Vercel deployment, here's how to redeploy:

## ðŸ“¤ **How to Manually Redeploy**

### **Option 1: Push to GitHub (Automatic Redeploy)**

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update base URL to production backend"
git push origin main
```

2. **Vercel will automatically redeploy:**
   - If your repo is connected to Vercel
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Your project will show a new deployment in progress
   - Wait for it to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

---

### **Option 2: Vercel Dashboard (Manual Trigger)**

1. **Go to your project dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your TrustSeal project

2. **Find the latest deployment:**
   - Scroll to "Deployments"
   - Click on the most recent one

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Click the "..." menu (three dots)
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Confirm and wait for completion

### **Option 3: Vercel CLI (Command Line)**

If you have Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Or if you haven't linked yet:
vercel link
vercel --prod
```

## âœ… **Current Status**

- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow commented out (won't trigger on push)
- âœ… Base URL updated to production backend
- âœ… Ready to push and redeploy

---

**Simplest method: Just push to GitHub, and Vercel will redeploy automatically!** ðŸŽ‰
